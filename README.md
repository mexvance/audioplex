# Audioplex purpose
Audioplex is an app that provides an alternative method to listen to audiobooks hosted on plex servers. Written in React Native it is accessible to both iOS and Android users alike.

It will be able to read mp3, m4b, and other audiobook formats, and will be able to store progress, analytics on reading, and other metadata that is not well supported by the main plex music functionality.
